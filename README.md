# Houses-Web-Scrapping-Web-Application

Implement scrapping service for NewHomeSource with Proxy template. If the link is already scrapped extract it from the cache, else run the link again. Use the JDBC library to store links in SQLite DB. Use JSoup to parse HTML, if needed.
The user will enter the region in which she/he would like to buy a house. The result will be all available houses in this district with links
